  <hr>
  <p> Being an independed developer, making games can sometimes be quite a long ride and usually <br>
      a pretty long and lonely one! But at the end of the day a finished game is nothing but a <br>
      a gas station for the developers to fuel up and prepare for another long ride! keeping our <br>
      players happy and actively playing our game! But what do I know? idk :)

  <p>Neon is a simple one click mobile game, my very first game that will go through <br>
      a little bit of self-marketing and publishing... </p>
  <p> It is still very early in development and since I am writing exams it will remain in hault <br>
      until the upcoming days of June and July</p>

  <p>Short sticks is actually my first android release... Here I kept everything simple <br>
     I think of this game as my first failure :)... its rather simple but unfortunately also <br>
     incomplete! I Know u must be wondering then why publish it? well answer is simple <br>
     I wanted to how hard it was to have a game no one knows about</p>
